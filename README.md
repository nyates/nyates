### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Nick Yates. I am a computer science and engineering teacher at [Patterson High School](https://www.pattersonclippers.org/) in Baltimore City Public Schools, Baltimore, Maryland, USA.

I'm also involved in several groups focused around teacher education in computer science and building a CS education community. I am an adjunct instructor in the [MAE in CS](https://professionalprograms.umbc.edu/master-of-arts-in-education/master-of-arts-in-education-programs/#cs) program at the University of Maryland Baltimore County. I am a professional development facilitator for [Maryland Center for Computing Education](https://cs4md.com/pd) (currently focusing on the CS Praxis, Mobile App Development, and Artificial Intelligence). And I am the treasurer for our statewide chapter of the Computer Science Teachers Association, [CSTA Maryland](https://maryland.csteachers.org/).

In the realm of engineering education, I am a sixteen-year member of the Baltimore City Schools Project Lead the Way Engineering Program Advisory Committee. And I am the treasurer for a 501(c)(3) nonprofit we created to support engineering classrooms in Baltimore City, the [Baltimore City Engineering Alliance (BCEA)](http://www.bceabmore.org/).
